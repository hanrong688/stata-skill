# Stata Skill for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that helps Claude write correct, idiomatic Stata code. Covers core Stata syntax, data management, econometrics, causal inference, graphics, Mata programming, and 17+ community packages.

## What's Included

**37 core reference files** covering:
- Data import/export, management, and cleaning
- Linear regression, panel data, time series
- Limited dependent variables, survival analysis, SEM
- Causal inference: DiD, RD, matching, treatment effects
- Mata programming and matrix operations
- Graphics, tables, and reporting
- Workflow best practices

**20 community package guides** including:
- `reghdfe` — high-dimensional fixed effects
- `estout` / `outreg2` — publication-quality tables
- `csdid`, `did_multiplegt` — modern DiD estimators
- `rdrobust` — regression discontinuity
- `psmatch2` — propensity score matching
- `synth` — synthetic control
- `ivreg2` / `xtabond2` — IV and dynamic panel GMM
- And more (binsreg, coefplot, grstyle, winsor2, gtools, ...)

## Installation

In Claude Code, run:

```
/install-skill https://github.com/dylantmoore/stata-skill
```

## How It Works

The skill uses **progressive disclosure**: a compact routing table (~370 lines) loaded on activation directs Claude to read only the 1-3 reference files relevant to the current task. This keeps context usage efficient while giving Claude access to 57 detailed reference documents when needed.
